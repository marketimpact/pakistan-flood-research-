# Pakistan Flood Hub Research - Final Summary Report

**Date**: June 20, 2025  
**Project**: Pakistan Flood Early Warning System (Pak-FEWS) Research  
**API Key Status**: ✅ Available  

## Executive Summary

This research investigated Google Flood Hub API coverage and capabilities for Pakistan, with specific focus on the urgent Chitral River flood warning. While API access revealed significant limitations, the research provides critical insights for Pak-FEWS development.

## Key Findings

### 1. API Capabilities & Limitations

#### What Works:
- ✅ **Individual Gauge Details**: `/v1/gauges/{gaugeId}` endpoint functional
- ✅ **Gauge Models**: Threshold data accessible via `/v1/gaugeModels/{gaugeId}`
- ✅ **Threshold Values**: Warning/Danger/Extreme levels available in m³/s

#### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ **Gauge Listing**: `/v1/gauges` endpoint returns 404
- ❌ **Area Search**: No working endpoint for geographic queries
- ❌ **Flood Status**: `/v1/floodStatus` returns 404 for most gauges
- ❌ **Bulk Queries**: Cannot retrieve comprehensive gauge inventory

### 2. Chitral River Emergency Verification

**Gauge**: hybas_4120570410  
**Status**: INCONCLUSIVE via API

#### Verified Data:
```json
{
  "location": {"latitude": 36.385, "longitude": 72.206},
  "qualityVerified": false,
  "hasModel": true,
  "thresholds": {
    "warningLevel": 59.34,
    "dangerLevel": 68.96,
    "extremeDangerLevel": 80.03
  },
  "unit": "CUBIC_METERS_PER_SECOND"
}
```

#### Critical Issues:
1. **NOT Quality Verified**: Gauge lacks quality certification
2. **No Active Predictions**: API provides no flood forecast data
3. **HYBAS Source**: Indicates modeled gauge, not physical station

### 3. Pakistan Coverage Assessment

Based on limited API access:
- **Total Gauges**: Unknown (listing endpoint non-functional)
- **Quality Verified**: Cannot determine percentage
- **Geographic Distribution**: Unable to map comprehensively

### 4. Data Quality Standards

From API responses:
- **qualityVerified**: Boolean flag indicating gauge reliability
- **hasModel**: Indicates hydrological model availability
- **Thresholds**: Based on return periods (2/5/20 years)

### 5. Alert Threshold Understanding

- **Warning Level**: 2-year return period (50% annual probability)
- **Danger Level**: 5-year return period (20% annual probability)
- **Extreme Danger**: 20-year return period (5% annual probability)

## Implications for Pak-FEWS Development

### Critical Requirements:

1. **Quality Filter Implementation**
   - Only use `qualityVerified: true` gauges for alerts
   - Current Chitral gauge would be excluded

2. **Alternative Data Sources**
   - API limitations require backup data providers
   - Consider PMD, WAPDA integration

3. **Manual Gauge Registry**
   - Cannot rely on API for gauge discovery
   - Must build custom Pakistan gauge database

4. **Hybrid Monitoring Approach**
   - Combine API data where available
   - Web scraping for comprehensive coverage
   - Local validation networks

### Technical Recommendations:

1. **Gauge-by-Gauge Approach**
   ```python
   # Since bulk queries fail, iterate known gauge IDs
   known_gauges = load_from_database()
   for gauge_id in known_gauges:
       details = api.get_gauge(gauge_id)
       model = api.get_gauge_model(gauge_id)
   ```

2. **Threshold Database**
   - Cache all threshold values locally
   - Update periodically (weekly/monthly)

3. **Quality Verification Protocol**
   - Establish criteria for non-verified gauges
   - Implement confidence scoring system

## Lessons from Chitral Alert

1. **Verification Challenges**: API alone insufficient for emergency verification
2. **Quality Concerns**: Many gauges lack quality verification
3. **Data Gaps**: No real-time predictions via API for many gauges
4. **Context Matters**: Historical patterns and monsoon forecasts crucial

## Next Steps

### Immediate (By June 25):
1. Continue monitoring Chitral situation
2. Document actual vs predicted outcomes
3. Test alternative data access methods

### Short-term (By July 2025):
1. Build comprehensive gauge database manually
2. Develop web scraping capabilities
3. Establish PMD/WAPDA partnerships

### Long-term (Pak-FEWS Development):
1. Implement multi-source data fusion
2. Create reliability scoring system
3. Build community validation networks

## API Usage Guidelines

### Working Endpoints:
```bash
# Get specific gauge details
GET https://floodforecasting.googleapis.com/v1/gauges/{gaugeId}?key={API_KEY}

# Get threshold model
GET https://floodforecasting.googleapis.com/v1/gaugeModels/{gaugeId}?key={API_KEY}
```

### Headers Required:
- `X-goog-api-key: {API_KEY}`
- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Conclusion

While Google Flood Hub provides valuable flood monitoring capabilities, significant API limitations require Pak-FEWS to adopt a hybrid approach combining:
1. Direct API access where functional
2. Web-based monitoring for comprehensive coverage
3. Local data sources for validation
4. Community-based verification networks

The Chitral case study highlights both the potential value and current limitations of relying solely on Google Flood Hub for Pakistan flood monitoring.
