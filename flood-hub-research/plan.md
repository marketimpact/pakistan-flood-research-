# Comprehensive Pakistani Gauge Discovery Plan (UPDATED)

## 🎯 Objective
Systematically discover ALL available Pakistani gauges in Google Flood Hub API, including both verified (high confidence) and lower confidence gauges.

## 📊 Key Insights (UPDATED)
- **Global Coverage**: 5,000+ verified gauges + 240,000+ lower confidence gauges
- **API Covers**: 150+ countries including Pakistan
- **Rate Limit**: 200 requests/minute
- **Two Quality Levels**: Verified (high confidence) vs Lower confidence gauges
- **API Reality**: List/search endpoints don't work - must discover by ID
- **Confirmed**: At least 2 Pakistani gauges exist (1 verified, 1 unverified)
- **Pattern Found**: HYBAS gauges with IDs like `hybas_412149XXXX`

## 🔍 Discovery Strategy

### Phase 1: Broad Area Search (Immediate)
1. **Test Multiple Endpoint Formats**
   - `GET /gauges` - List all accessible gauges
   - `GET /gauges:searchByArea` - Area-based search
   - `GET /gauges:search` - General search endpoint
   - `GET /gauges:batchGet` - Batch retrieval

2. **Geographic Grid Search**
   - Divide Pakistan into 1°x1° grid cells
   - Query each grid cell separately
   - Aggregate results to avoid missing gauges

3. **Run Updated gauge_inventory.py**
   - Already has multiple endpoint attempts
   - Includes area filtering logic
   - Exports comprehensive CSV

### Phase 2: Pattern-Based Discovery
1. **Analyze Gauge ID Patterns**
   - Known pattern: `hybas_XXXXXXXXXX`
   - Look for patterns like:
     - `pk_XXX` (Pakistan specific)
     - `pmd_XXX` (Pakistan Meteorological Department)
     - `wapda_XXX` (Water and Power Development Authority)
     - Regional codes for South Asia

2. **Systematic ID Generation**
   - For HYBAS gauges: Try sequential IDs around known gauge
   - Test common Pakistani river basin codes
   - Try major city/region identifiers

### Phase 3: River-Based Search
1. **Major Pakistani Rivers**
   - Indus River system (main stem + tributaries)
   - Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, Beas
   - Kabul, Swat, Kurram rivers
   - Coastal rivers in Sindh/Balochistan

2. **Query by River Name**
   - Search for gauges with river names
   - Cross-reference with Pakistani hydrology data

### Phase 4: Quality Assessment
1. **Categorize Discovered Gauges**
   - Verified (qualityVerified: true)
   - Has Model (hasModel: true)
   - Lower confidence (qualityVerified: false)
   - Map coverage gaps

2. **Priority Ranking**
   - High: Verified + Model
   - Medium: Either verified OR model
   - Low: Neither (but still useful)

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps (REVISED)

### Step 1: Focused HYBAS Pattern Search (PRIORITY)
Since we know HYBAS gauges exist in Pakistan:
```python
# Confirmed pattern: hybas_412149XXXX
# Test exhaustively around known gauges:
base_patterns = [
    '412149',  # Known pattern (2 gauges found)
    '412148',  # Adjacent basin
    '412150',  # Adjacent basin
    '412147',  # Wider search
    '412151'   # Wider search
]

for base in base_patterns:
    for i in range(10000):  # Test all 4-digit suffixes
        gauge_id = f'hybas_{base}{i:04d}'
        # Test if exists and in Pakistan bounds
```

### Step 2: Regional HYBAS Codes
```python
# South Asian HYBAS basin codes (likely Pakistan regions)
regional_codes = [
    '411', '412', '413', '414', '415',  # Western basins
    '421', '422', '423', '424', '425',  # Central basins
    '611', '612', '613', '614', '615'   # Eastern basins
]
```

### Step 2: Geographic Grid Search (1 hour)
```python
# Create 1-degree grid cells covering Pakistan
for lat in range(23, 38):  # 23°N to 37°N
    for lon in range(60, 78):  # 60°E to 77°E
        query_area(lat, lat+1, lon, lon+1)
```

### Step 3: Gauge ID Pattern Search (2 hours)
```python
# Test systematic patterns
prefixes = ['hybas_', 'pk_', 'pmd_', 'wapda_', 'indus_']
# Try different ID formats
```

### Step 4: Data Aggregation (30 min)
- Combine all discovered gauges
- Remove duplicates
- Export comprehensive inventory

## 📋 Expected Outcomes

### Minimum Expected
- 50-100 Pakistani gauges (based on global distribution)
- Coverage of major rivers
- Mix of verified and lower confidence

### Optimistic Scenario
- 200-500 Pakistani gauges
- Complete Indus basin coverage
- Urban flood monitoring gauges
- High percentage verified

## 🔧 Tools & Scripts

### Primary Script
```bash
python gauge_inventory.py
```

### Supplementary Scripts
1. `grid_search.py` - Geographic grid search
2. `pattern_discovery.py` - ID pattern testing
3. `river_search.py` - River-based queries
4. `gauge_validator.py` - Quality assessment

## 📊 Success Metrics

1. **Coverage Metrics**
   - Total gauges discovered
   - Verified vs lower confidence ratio
   - Geographic distribution
   - River coverage percentage

2. **Quality Metrics**

## 🚨 Contingency Plans

### If Few Gauges Found
1. Request enhanced API access
2. Contact Google support for Pakistan-specific access
3. Explore alternative endpoints
4. Check for regional restrictions

### If Rate Limited
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Batch requests efficiently
3. Cache results aggressively
4. Spread queries over time

4. **Create production gauge database** for Pak-FEWS

## 🚀 Aggressive Discovery Script

```python
# Run this for comprehensive discovery:
import concurrent.futures
import requests

def test_gauge_batch(base, start, end):
    """Test a batch of gauge IDs"""
    found = []
    for i in range(start, end):
        gauge_id = f'hybas_{base}{i:04d}'
        if check_gauge_exists(gauge_id):
            found.append(gauge_id)
    return found

# Parallel execution for speed
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=10) as executor:
    futures = []
    for base in ['412149', '412148', '412150']:
        for batch_start in range(0, 10000, 100):
            future = executor.submit(test_gauge_batch, base, batch_start, batch_start+100)
            futures.append(future)
    
    # Collect results
    all_gauges = []
    for future in concurrent.futures.as_completed(futures):
        all_gauges.extend(future.result())
```

## 📊 Expected Outcomes (REVISED)

### Based on Current Discovery Rate (0.2%)
- Testing 50,000 IDs → ~100 gauges expected
- Testing 100,000 IDs → ~200 gauges expected
- Testing 500,000 IDs → ~1000 gauges expected

### Geographic Distribution (Expected)
- Sindh: 30-40% (current: 100%)
- Punjab: 25-35% (current: 0%)
- KPK: 15-25% (current: 0%)
- Balochistan: 10-20% (current: 0%)
- GB/AJK: 5-10% (current: 0%)

## 💡 Critical Success Factors

1. **Persistence**: Must test thousands of IDs
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Focus on successful patterns
3. **Rate Management**: Stay under 200 req/min limit
4. **Quality Tracking**: Separate verified vs unverified

## 📝 Final Notes

- **Confirmed**: Multiple Pakistani gauges exist in API
- **Challenge**: No discovery endpoints - must brute force
- **Solution**: Systematic ID testing with patterns
- **Timeline**: 48-72 hours for comprehensive discovery
- **Resources**: Requires dedicated compute time
