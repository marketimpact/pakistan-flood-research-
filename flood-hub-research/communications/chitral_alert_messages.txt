Subject: Flood Forecast Verification - Chitral River Gauge hybas_4120570410

PDMA KP Team,

We are conducting verification of flood forecasts from Google Flood Hub for research purposes. Initial reports suggest potential flooding at Chitral River gauge hybas_4120570410:

GAUGE DETAILS:
- Location: Chitral, KPK (36.386°N, 72.202°E)
- Reported Timeline: Warning level ~15 hours, Danger level ~5 days
- Source: Google Flood Hub (public research tool)

VERIFICATION STATUS:
- Method: Manual website review (no API access)
- Quality: Cannot verify gauge certification status
- Limitations: Approximate readings only, no official thresholds

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS:
- This is UNOFFICIAL monitoring for research purposes
- NOT a substitute for official PDMA/PMD warnings
- Based on experimental Google research system
- Accuracy and reliability not independently verified

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Check official PMD/WAPDA sources for corroboration
2. Verify with local district administration
3. Monitor local conditions independently
4. Do not rely solely on this information for emergency response

Chitral Flood Alert - Research Monitoring

Hi team,

Quick heads up - we're seeing potential flood warnings for Chitral River in our research monitoring of Google's flood prediction system.

What we're seeing:
- Warning level possibly in next 15 hours
- Danger level possibly by June 25
- Based on gauge hybas_4120570410 near Chitral city

Important notes:
- This is from experimental Google system (not official)
- We're doing web-based monitoring only (no API access)
- Cannot verify exact accuracy or official status
- This is for our Pak-FEWS research project

What to do:
- Check with local contacts if you have them
- Monitor official channels (PMD, PDMA)
- Treat this as early intel, not official warning
- Help us track if this proves accurate for our research

Will update as we learn more.

Pak-FEWS Research Log: Chitral Flood Forecast Case Study
Date: June 20, 2025

CASE STUDY OVERVIEW:
This represents our first real-time verification of Google Flood Hub predictions for Pakistan. The Chitral River gauge (hybas_4120570410) is showing potential flood warnings, providing an opportunity to test our monitoring methodology.

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:
1. Verify accuracy of Google Flood Hub predictions
2. Test web-based monitoring procedures (no API access)
3. Evaluate information quality and reliability
4. Document lessons learned for system design

METHODOLOGY LIMITATIONS:
- No API access - relying on website screenshots
- Cannot verify gauge quality certification
- Approximate timeline readings only
- No access to confidence intervals or model details

TRACKING METRICS:
- Forecast accuracy (timing and magnitude)
- Local authority response correlation
- Community impact assessment
- False positive/negative rates

FOLLOW-UP PLAN:
- Monitor every 6 hours for next 7 days
- Document actual outcomes vs predictions
- Interview local contacts if possible
- Incorporate lessons into Pak-FEWS design

SYSTEM DESIGN IMPLICATIONS:
- Need official API access for production system
- Require backup verification methods
- Must establish clear disclaimer protocols
- Should include uncertainty communication

LESSONS LEARNED:
[To be updated as case study progresses]
