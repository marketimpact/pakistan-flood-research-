# Chitral River Flood Alert Verification Plan (Web-Based)

## Urgent Task: Verify and Document Flood Forecast for KPK

**Gauge ID**: hybas_4120570410  
**Location**: Chitral River, KPK, Pakistan  
**Reported Status**: Warning level in 15 hours, Danger level by Wednesday June 25  
**URL**: https://sites.research.google/floods/l/36.38591277287651/72.2021484375/10/g/hybas_4120570410

**Note**: No API access available - using web-based verification approach

## Phase 1: Manual Web Verification (10 minutes)

### Task 1: Manual Website Check
**URL**: https://sites.research.google/floods/l/36.38591277287651/72.2021484375/10/g/hybas_4120570410

**Required Actions**:
1. **Screenshot Documentation**:
   - Full page screenshot
   - Forecast graph closeup
   - Map view (current/forecast toggle)
   - Alert level indicators
   - "About this forecast" section

2. **Data Points to Extract**:
   - Current alert status (color/level)
   - Warning threshold crossing time
   - Danger threshold crossing time
   - Peak forecast level and timing
   - Map data availability
   - Last update timestamp

### Expected Information Sources:
- Interactive forecast graph showing discharge over time
- Color-coded alert levels (green/yellow/orange/red)
- Map overlay showing affected areas
- Forecast confidence indicators

## Phase 2: Data Analysis (10 minutes)

### Task 2: Analyze and Interpret Results
**File: `reports/chitral_web_analysis.md`**

Check and document from website:
- **Current Status**: Visual alert level (green/yellow/orange/red)
- **Graph Analysis**: Estimate discharge values from forecast curve
- **Timeline**: Extract approximate times for threshold crossings
- **Map Status**: Note if inundation maps are available
- **Data Quality**: Look for any verification indicators
- **Update Frequency**: Check last update timestamp

### Generate Output:
```
CHITRAL RIVER FLOOD ALERT - WEB-BASED ANALYSIS
==============================================
Generated: [timestamp]
Gauge ID: hybas_4120570410
Location: Chitral, KPK, Pakistan (36.386°N, 72.202°E)
Source: Google Flood Hub Website (Manual Review)

CURRENT STATUS:
- Alert Level: [from visual indicators]
- Graph Status: [normal/elevated/critical]
- Map Data: [available/unavailable]
- Last Update: [timestamp from website]

FORECAST TIMELINE (estimated from graph):
- Warning Level Breach: [approximate time]
- Danger Level Breach: [approximate time]
- Peak Forecast: [estimated peak and timing]

LIMITATIONS OF WEB-BASED ANALYSIS:
- No exact threshold values
- Approximate timings only
- Cannot verify quality status
- No access to confidence intervals
- No notification polygon data

VISUAL EVIDENCE:
- Screenshots attached: [list files]
- Graph interpretation: [description]

ASSESSMENT:
[Your analysis based on visual information]

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
[Based on findings and limitations]
```

## Phase 3: Historical Context (15 minutes)

### Task 3: Check Historical Patterns
**Approach**: Web research and documentation

Check available sources for context:
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Research typical June discharge for Chitral River
- **Recent History**: Look for news of previous floods in Chitral region
- **Monsoon Context**: Confirm if this aligns with 2025 monsoon onset
- **Local Reports**: Search for any local authority warnings or reports

## Phase 4: Create Alert Report (10 minutes)

### Task 4: Generate Formal Report
**File: `reports/chitral_flood_alert_20250620.md`**

Structure:
1. **Executive Summary** (3 sentences max)
2. **Technical Verification** (API findings)
3. **Risk Assessment** (based on thresholds)
4. **Limitations** (what we don't know)
5. **Recommended Actions**

### Task 5: Create Visualization
**File: `visualizations/chitral_forecast_chart.html`**

Simple time-series plot showing:
- Current discharge
- Forecast trajectory
- Threshold lines (warning/danger/extreme)
- Uncertainty bounds if available

## Phase 5: Communication Package (10 minutes)

### Task 6: Prepare Stakeholder Messages
**File: `communications/chitral_alert_messages.txt`**

Create three versions:
1. **Technical (for PDMA KP)**:
   - Full technical details
   - API verification status
   - Caveats about unofficial nature

2. **Informal (for KP colleagues)**:
   - Simple language
   - Focus on timing and severity
   - Clear disclaimer

3. **Project Documentation**:
   - Lessons learned
   - System performance notes
   - Follow-up tracking plan

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] API responding correctly
- [ ] Gauge is quality verified
- [ ] Thresholds are reasonable (not anomalous)
- [ ] Forecast times are in correct timezone (UTC → PKT)
- [ ] Notification polygon check completed
- [ ] Historical context analyzed
- [ ] Report reviewed for accuracy

## Error Handling
If API fails or data is suspicious:
1. Document the failure
2. Try alternative endpoints
3. Check Google Flood Hub website directly
4. Note discrepancies between API and website

## Quick Commands (Web-Based)
```bash
# Create directories
mkdir -p flood-hub-research/{reports,screenshots,communications}

# Open the flood hub page
open "https://sites.research.google/floods/l/36.38591277287651/72.2021484375/10/g/hybas_4120570410"

# Create analysis report
touch reports/chitral_web_analysis_20250620.md

# Create screenshot folder
mkdir -p screenshots/chitral_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Time-Critical Notes
- Current time: June 20, 2025
- Warning level: ~15 hours (June 21, ~3 AM PKT)
- Danger level: ~5 days (June 25)
- This is URGENT - complete within 1 hour

## Follow-up Actions∑ß
After initial check:
1. Set up monitoring script to check every hour
2. Track if/when local authorities issue warnings
3. Document actual vs predicted levels
4. Use as test case for Pak-FEWS system design
