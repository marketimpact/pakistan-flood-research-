# CHITRAL RIVER FLOOD ALERT - API VERIFICATION REPORT

**Generated**: June 20, 2025 11:36 UTC  
**Gauge ID**: hybas_4120570410  
**Location**: Chitral, KPK, Pakistan (36.385¬∞N, 72.206¬∞E)  
**Data Source**: Google Flood Hub API (Direct Access)

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS

### Gauge Status
- **Gauge Exists**: ‚úÖ **YES** - Valid gauge in Google Flood Hub system
- **Quality Verified**: ‚ùå **NO** - Not quality verified (use with appropriate caution)
- **Has Model**: ‚úÖ **YES** - Full hydrological model with thresholds available
- **Source**: HYBAS (Hydro Basin System)
- **Usability**: **MEDIUM-HIGH** - Valuable despite lack of verification

### Flood Thresholds (Confirmed via API)
- **Warning Level**: **59.34 m¬≥/s** (2-year return period)
- **Danger Level**: **68.96 m¬≥/s** (5-year return period)  
- **Extreme Danger Level**: **80.03 m¬≥/s** (20-year return period)
- **Unit**: CUBIC_METERS_PER_SECOND

### Current Flood Status
- **API Response**: 404 Not Found - No active flood predictions available
- **Interpretation**: Either:
  1. No current flood risk detected by the system
  2. Predictions not available for non-quality-verified gauges
  3. System not actively monitoring this gauge

## ‚ö†Ô∏è RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Important Considerations:
1. **Not Quality Verified**: Lower confidence than verified gauges, but still useful
2. **No Active Predictions**: Must rely on threshold values without real-time forecasts
3. **HYBAS Source**: Hydrologically modeled gauge based on basin characteristics
4. **Threshold Reliability**: Warning/danger levels are scientifically derived

### Practical Implications:
- **Use With Disclaimers**: Valuable for monitoring but acknowledge limitations
- **Cross-Reference**: Compare with local PMD/WAPDA data when possible
- **Threshold Focus**: Monitor local conditions against known warning levels
- **Early Warning Value**: Even without predictions, thresholds enable proactive monitoring

## üìä TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### What We Know:
1. **Gauge Exists**: Valid gauge ID in the system at correct location
2. **Model Available**: Hydrological model with defined thresholds
3. **Threshold Values**: Clear warning levels defined in m¬≥/s
4. **Geographic Match**: Coordinates match Chitral River location

### What's Missing:
1. **Current Discharge**: No real-time flow measurements
2. **Forecast Data**: No predictions available via API
3. **Quality Metrics**: No confidence intervals or accuracy data
4. **Historical Performance**: Cannot assess past prediction accuracy

## üéØ ASSESSMENT: GAUGE USABLE WITH LIMITATIONS

Based on API verification:

1. **Gauge is Valid**: Chitral gauge EXISTS and provides threshold data
2. **Known Warning Levels**: Clear thresholds at 59.34/68.96/80.03 m¬≥/s
3. **No Real-time Data**: Cannot confirm current flood status via API
4. **Monitoring Possible**: Can compare local flow measurements to thresholds

**Recommendation**: USE this gauge for Pak-FEWS with appropriate disclaimers about verification status.

## üìã RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Alternative Verification**: 
   - Check PMD/WAPDA for Chitral River discharge data
   - Contact local authorities for ground truth
   - Monitor news sources for flood reports

2. **Website Check**: 
   - Visit the Google Flood Hub website directly
   - Website may show data not available via API
   - Screenshot any predictions shown

3. **Caution Advised**:
   - Despite API limitations, flood risk cannot be ruled out
   - Pakistan is experiencing early monsoon with 20% above-normal rainfall
   - Chitral has recent flood history (2023, 2024)

### For Pak-FEWS Development:
1. **Include Non-Verified Gauges**: Use ALL available gauges with quality indicators
2. **ID Database Priority**: Focus on building comprehensive gauge ID list
3. **Threshold-Based Monitoring**: Design system around known warning levels
4. **Quality Indicators**: Show verification status clearly in UI (üü¢ Verified / üü° Unverified)

## üîç NEXT STEPS

1. **Expand Search**: Query all Pakistan gauges to find quality-verified ones
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Determine why some gauges lack predictions
3. **Alternative Endpoints**: Test other API methods for flood data
4. **Ground Truth**: Establish local verification network
