# Publicly Available APIs for Real-Time River Gauge Data in Pakistan

## Current state of river gauge data access reveals limited public APIs

Based on comprehensive research across government agencies, international organizations, and open data platforms, Pakistan's real-time river gauge data ecosystem remains largely closed to public access. While multiple agencies collect hydrological data, standardized public APIs with technical documentation are virtually non-existent. The most promising developments involve pilot projects and internal telemetry systems that could potentially evolve into public data services.

## Pakistan government agencies operate fragmented internal systems

### Pakistan Meteorological Department shows API potential

The PMD operates a Flood Forecasting Division (ffd.pmd.gov.pk) that monitors river conditions and provides flood forecasts. In 2017, LMKT/Code for Pakistan developed a weather API for PMD that transitioned data access from Excel sheets to real-time web interfaces. However, this API focuses on meteorological rather than hydrological data, and no specific river gauge endpoints were documented.

**Technical specifications remain unclear:**
- **Endpoints**: Not publicly documented
- **Authentication**: Unknown requirements
- **Data format**: Transitioning from Excel to web-based
- **Coverage**: All major rivers during flood season (July-September)
- **Update frequency**: Daily reports available

### Provincial irrigation departments maintain isolated monitoring systems

Punjab leads provincial efforts with its Real-Time Flow Monitoring System (rtfms.irrigation.punjab.gov.pk), though the portal blocks public access. The system monitors 25 canal systems across Mangla and Tarbela commands, with recent World Bank-funded installations of AI-based discharge monitoring at select locations.

**Punjab RTFMS characteristics:**
- **Access**: Restricted (robots.txt blocks crawlers)
- **Coverage**: 25 canal systems with designed and actual discharge data
- **Technology**: IWMI pilot using real-time flow measurement at 17 locations
- **Data types**: Head/tail gauge readings, discharge measurements
- **Future potential**: AI integration for precise monitoring

Other provinces lag significantly - Sindh manages three major barrages without public data access, KPK operates 35 gauging stations for internal hydropower planning, and Balochistan has minimal technological infrastructure.

### WAPDA and FFC coordinate flood monitoring without public APIs

The Water and Power Development Authority operates a sophisticated Flood Telemetric Network linked directly with the Federal Flood Commission. This system includes rim stations measuring snow melt and inflows at critical locations (Bishma, Ogi, Phulra, Tarbela, Daggar), transmitting data to the National Flood Forecasting Bureau in Lahore.

**System capabilities versus public access:**
- **Infrastructure**: Advanced telemetry and transmission centers
- **Data flow**: Real-time to government agencies only
- **Public access**: Limited to daily situation reports during flood season
- **Format**: PDF reports rather than machine-readable data

## International organizations provide limited Pakistan coverage

### ICIMOD offers the most relevant international tool

The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development provides the only Pakistan-specific river forecasting tool among international organizations. Their Streamflow Prediction Tool (tethys.icimod.org/apps/streamflowpakistan/) covers 1,788 unique river segments with 10-day forecasts.

**ICIMOD Streamflow Tool specifications:**
- **URL**: http://tethys.icimod.org/apps/streamflowpakistan/
- **API**: None - web visualization only
- **Coverage**: Complete Pakistan river network
- **Update frequency**: Daily
- **Data type**: Forecast models, not real gauge measurements
- **Authentication**: Open access

### NASA provides satellite-based flood detection

NASA's Global Flood Monitoring System offers near real-time flood detection at 12km and 1km resolution with 3-hourly updates. While valuable for flood monitoring, this system doesn't provide actual river gauge measurements.

**NASA LANCE flood products:**
- **Access**: Free through NASA Earthdata
- **Format**: HDF/GeoTIFF files
- **Coverage**: Global including Pakistan
- **Update frequency**: Daily composites
- **Limitation**: Satellite detection, not ground measurements

### WMO and GRDC focus on historical data

Neither the World Meteorological Organization's HydroSOS system nor the Global Runoff Data Centre provides real-time Pakistan river data through APIs. GRDC offers historical discharge data with 1-2 year lag times, requiring registration for downloads in ASCII/CSV format.

## Emerging opportunities through digitalization initiatives

### PCRWR operates advanced telemetry without public access

The Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources maintains the most advanced monitoring infrastructure, with telemetry systems covering 10 canals in KPK and one canal each in Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. Data displays at PCRWR headquarters and IRSA but lacks public API access.

**PCRWR Indus Telemetry System:**
- **Technology**: Velocity radar sensors with ADCP validation
- **Data transmission**: Satellite-based to government offices
- **Coverage**: 13 canals across Pakistan
- **Collaboration**: IWMI partnership
- **Public access**: None documented

### Open data portals lack real-time hydrological data

Provincial initiatives like KP Open Data Portal (opendata.kp.gov.pk) provide access to over 6,000 datasets but focus on socioeconomic rather than real-time environmental data. The collaborative Open Data Pakistan portal by LUMS and HEC includes flood/drought records without real-time gauge access.

### Commercial weather APIs offer meteorological but not gauge data

Several commercial providers cover Pakistan with weather data:
- **Open-Meteo**: Free for non-commercial use, no API key required
- **Tomorrow.io**: Free tier with 60+ weather layers
- **WeatherAPI.com**: Free tier includes historical data

None provide river gauge measurements specifically.

## Critical gaps and recommendations for data access

The research reveals Pakistan lacks a unified, publicly accessible river gauge data API despite extensive monitoring infrastructure. Government agencies collect comprehensive data through modern telemetry systems but restrict access to internal use. International organizations provide supplementary satellite-based monitoring and forecasting tools but cannot replace ground-based measurements.

**For immediate data needs, consider:**
1. Contacting PCRWR directly for research collaborations
2. Using ICIMOD's streamflow prediction tool for forecast data
3. Monitoring NASA LANCE for flood detection
4. Exploring commercial weather APIs for related meteorological data
5. Requesting specific datasets through provincial open data portals

**Long-term solutions require:**
- Policy advocacy for public data access
- Standardization across government agencies  
- Technical documentation development
- International partnership expansion
- Investment in API infrastructure

The current landscape demands direct institutional relationships for accessing real-time river gauge data, as no comprehensive public API service exists for Pakistan's water monitoring networks.
