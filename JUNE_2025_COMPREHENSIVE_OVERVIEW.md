# Thomas Byrnes - Pakistan Work Overview (June 2025)

## Executive Summary
In June 2025, Thomas Byrnes contributed to two major initiatives for Pakistan's disaster risk management and social protection systems:
1. **Google Flood Hub Research**: Comprehensive API investigation for Pakistan flood monitoring system
2. **ISPIS/IBR System Architecture**: Strategic review and guidance for integrated social protection systems

## Project 1: Pakistan Flood Early Warning System (Pak-FEWS) Research

### Overview
Conducted systematic research on Google Flood Hub API to assess feasibility of building a lightweight flood monitoring system providing 24-hour advance warnings for Pakistan.

### Key Deliverables

#### Research Outputs
- **117 gauges discovered** through systematic API exploration (up from initial 1-2)
- **Comprehensive gauge inventory** with metadata and quality assessments
- **Interactive coverage maps** showing geographic distribution
- **Threshold analysis** for major rivers including Indus, Jhelum, Chenab
- **Chitral emergency case study** demonstrating real-world application

#### Technical Implementation
- Python API wrapper for Google Flood Hub integration
- Gauge discovery algorithms using pattern matching
- Data analysis and visualization tools
- CSV/JSON data exports for system integration

### Critical Findings
1. **API Limitations**:
   - No gauge listing or geographic search endpoints
   - Operates as "lookup service" requiring known gauge IDs
   - No real-time flood predictions via API
   - Limited quality-verified gauges for Pakistan

2. **Coverage Gaps**:
   - Most gauges unverified (`qualityVerified: false`)
   - Concentration in Sindh/Balochistan, gaps in KP/Punjab
   - Major rivers have partial coverage only

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Build hybrid system combining Google data with local sources
   - Implement web scraping for comprehensive monitoring
   - Cache threshold data locally for reliability
   - Cross-validate with PMD/WAPDA data

### Impact
Research provides foundation for building cost-effective flood monitoring system within $10,000 budget constraint, complementing existing NDMA infrastructure.

## Project 2: Integrated Social Protection Information System (ISPIS)

### Early June (June 3-13)

#### Comprehensive SRS Review
- Reviewed 160+ page Software Requirements Specification
- Focused analysis on:
  - **IBR (Integrated Beneficiary Registry)** modules
  - **ASP (Adaptive Social Protection)** functionality
  - **NSER (National Socio-Economic Registry)** data exchange

#### Strategic Recommendations
- Proposed documentation restructuring:
  - Core IBR specification as focused document
  - Separate SRS documents for ASP and NSER modules
  - Improved manageability and actionability

#### Technical Issues Identified
- Critical conflict between NGEN's Node.js proposal and Laravel/PHP specification
- Recommended alignment with existing technical stack

### Mid-June (June 16)

#### Project Charter Development
Created two comprehensive project charters for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa:

##### 1. PDMA KP Data Exchange Architecture & PDRIS Enablement
- Designed PDRIS as enabler for anticipatory action
- Mapped data flows: early warning â†’ SP system notification
- Technical specifications: REST APIs, JSON, OAuth 2.0
- Timeline: Chitral pilot Q2 2026

##### 2. PP&SPRU KP Integrated Social Protection Information System
- Provincial hub connecting 12 departments
- Addressed challenges:
  - CNIC data quality issues
  - Pending BISP MOU
- Realistic MVP timeline: Q4 2025 for 6 departments
- Theory of change linking to shock-responsive objectives

### Late June (June 21)

#### Final Review and Approval
- Completed review of Chapters 4 & 5 from NGEN
- Supported pragmatic approach: keep ASP/NSER in Phase-1 MVP
- Acknowledged resource constraints
- Focused on critical milestone achievement

## Integrated Impact

### Synergies Between Projects
1. **Data Integration**: Flood Hub research feeds into PDRIS early warning system
2. **Beneficiary Targeting**: Flood predictions enable anticipatory SP responses
3. **Technical Architecture**: Both systems use compatible REST/JSON standards
4. **Provincial Coordination**: KP systems designed for interoperability

### Key Achievements
- **Technical Leadership**: Guided complex system architectures
- **Strategic Vision**: Balanced ideal outcomes with practical constraints
- **Collaborative Approach**: Worked effectively with NGEN, PDMA, PP&SPRU teams
- **Documentation**: Created actionable, well-structured technical specifications

### Timeline Alignment
- **Q4 2025**: ISPIS MVP launch (6 departments)
- **Q2 2026**: Chitral pilot integrating flood warnings with social protection
- **Ongoing**: Flood Hub system development and enhancement

## Recommendations Going Forward

1. **Integration Priority**: Connect Flood Hub threshold data with PDRIS for automated beneficiary alerts
2. **Data Quality**: Establish validation protocols for both flood and beneficiary data
3. **Capacity Building**: Train local teams on both systems simultaneously
4. **Monitoring Framework**: Unified M&E for disaster response and social protection outcomes
5. **Sustainability**: Design for local ownership and maintenance within budget constraints

## Conclusion
June 2025 work established critical foundations for Pakistan's integrated approach to disaster risk management and adaptive social protection, with technical solutions designed for real-world constraints and maximum impact for vulnerable populations.
