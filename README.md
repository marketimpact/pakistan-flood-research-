# Pakistan Comprehensive Flood Hub Analyzer

A comprehensive system for flood monitoring and early warning using all Google Flood Hub APIs. This tool integrates gauge classification, flood status monitoring, and threshold analysis to support the development of Pak-FEWS (Pakistan Flood Early Warning System).

## Overview

This project provides a complete flood monitoring solution that:
- **Integrates all 3 Google Flood Hub APIs**: gauges, gaugeModels, and floodStatus
- **Classifies gauges** as physical or virtual with confidence scoring
- **Monitors real-time flood conditions** with severity assessment
- **Provides reliability-based alerting** with 4-tier confidence system
- **Cross-references with Pakistani databases** (WAPDA, PMD, FFD, NDMA)
- **Generates actionable intelligence** for emergency response

## Key Features

### üîç Intelligent Classification
- Multi-factor confidence scoring algorithm
- External validation against known Pakistani stations
- Evidence-based decision making

### üìä Comprehensive Analysis
- Geographic distribution analysis
- Source reliability assessment  
- Quality verification tracking
- Coverage gap identification

### üìã Complete Reporting
- CSV gauge inventory with full metadata
- Markdown research findings report
- JSON analysis data for further processing
- High-priority gauge recommendations

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Basic Classification Analysis**
   ```bash
   python3 integrated_analyzer.py --verbose
   ```

3. **Run Comprehensive Flood Analysis (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   python3 comprehensive_flood_analyzer.py
   ```

4. **With API Key (for live data)**
   ```bash
   python3 comprehensive_flood_analyzer.py --api-key YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY
   ```

## Generated Files

The system generates several output files:

- `gauge_inventory_complete_TIMESTAMP.csv` - Complete gauge database
- `comprehensive_analysis_TIMESTAMP.json` - Detailed analysis data  
- `high_priority_gauges_TIMESTAMP.csv` - Recommended gauges for implementation
- `external_stations_reference_TIMESTAMP.csv` - Pakistani government station database
- `research_findings_TIMESTAMP.md` - Executive summary and recommendations

## Classification System

### Confidence Scoring
The system uses a weighted algorithm to score each gauge:

- **Named site/river**: +30/+20 points
- **Physical network source** (GRDC/WAPDA/PMD): +40 points  
- **Quality verification**: +10 points
- **Non-HYBAS ID format**: +20 points
- **External station match**: +10-40 points (distance-based)

### Classification Levels
- **Verified Physical** (80+ points): High confidence physical gauge
- **Likely Physical** (60-79 points): Probable physical gauge
- **Uncertain** (30-59 points): Requires additional verification
- **Likely Virtual** (<30 points): Probable virtual/modeled gauge

## External Data Sources

The system cross-references against 37 known Pakistani stations from:

- **WAPDA**: 16 major dams and barrages
- **PMD**: 8 meteorological/hydrological stations  
- **FFD**: 8 Federal Flood Division monitoring points
- **NDMA**: 5 disaster management reference points

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`gauge_analyzer.py`** - Main classification engine
2. **`external_validators.py`** - Pakistani database cross-reference
3. **`integrated_analyzer.py`** - Complete analysis pipeline
4. **`django_models.py`** - Database models for system implementation

### Key Classes

- `PakistanGaugeAnalyzer` - Core gauge analysis and classification
- `ExternalValidationService` - Cross-reference with Pakistani databases
- `IntegratedGaugeAnalyzer` - Complete pipeline orchestration

## API Integration

The system is designed to work with Google Flood Hub API:

```python
# Example API call structure
GET /v1/gauges?bounds=23.5,60.5,37.5,77.5

# Expected response format
{
  "gauges": [{
    "gaugeId": "PKGR0001",
    "location": {"latitude": 33.9, "longitude": 72.7},
    "source": "GRDC",
    "siteName": "Tarbela Dam", 
    "river": "Indus River",
    "qualityVerified": true,
    "hasModel": true
  }]
}
```

## Implementation for Pak-FEWS

### Phase 1: High-Priority Gauges
Start with gauges meeting these criteria:
- Confidence score ‚â• 70
- Quality verified by Google
- Preferably physical network sources

### Phase 2: Quality HYBAS Gauges  
Include HYBAS gauges with:
- `qualityVerified: true`
- Confidence score ‚â• 50
- Clear labeling as AI-predicted

### Phase 3: User Feedback Integration
Implement feedback system to:
- Validate classifications
- Improve confidence scoring
- Update gauge reliability over time

## Django Integration

Use the provided Django models for production implementation:

```python
from django_models import RiverGauge, GaugeClassification

# Create gauge from API data
gauge = RiverGauge.objects.create(
    gauge_id="PKGR0001",
    latitude=33.9,
    longitude=72.7,
    classification=GaugeClassification.VERIFIED_PHYSICAL,
    confidence_score=85
)
```

## Sample Results

Based on test data analysis:
- **Total Gauges**: 3 (sample)
- **Verified Physical**: 2 gauges  
- **Quality Verified**: 100%
- **External Matches**: 67%
- **Average Confidence Boost**: 26.7 points

## Contributing

This system implements the methodology outlined in `plan3.md`. Contributions should:
- Follow the confidence scoring algorithm
- Maintain external validation accuracy
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation for new features
