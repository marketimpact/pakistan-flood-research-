# Pakistan Google Flood Hub - Real Data Analysis

**Analysis Date:** June 20, 2025
**API Key Used:** Working (validated)
**Data Source:** Google Flood Hub API (Official)

## Executive Summary

Google Flood Hub API operates on a **"know the ID, query the gauge"** model. While individual gauge data is accessible IF you have the gauge ID, there's no way to discover gauges programmatically. We verified **2 specific gauges** including the Chitral River gauge which EXISTS but is NOT quality verified. Real-time flood predictions remain unavailable through the API.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Verified Gauges

#### 1. hybas_4121489010 (Balochistan)
**Location:** 26.060¬∞N, 68.931¬∞E  
**Quality Status:** ‚úÖ Quality Verified  
**Model Status:** ‚úÖ Has Predictive Model  
**Suitability:** HIGH - Best available gauge for Pak-FEWS

**Flood Thresholds:**
- Warning Level: 6.76 m¬≥/s
- Danger Level: 34.07 m¬≥/s
- Extreme Danger: 207.55 m¬≥/s

#### 2. hybas_4120570410 (Chitral River, KPK)
**Location:** 36.385¬∞N, 72.206¬∞E  
**Quality Status:** ‚ùå NOT Quality Verified  
**Model Status:** ‚úÖ Has Predictive Model  
**Suitability:** MEDIUM - Use with caution

**Flood Thresholds:**
- Warning Level: 59.34 m¬≥/s
- Danger Level: 68.96 m¬≥/s
- Extreme Danger: 80.03 m¬≥/s

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical API Limitations

1. **No Gauge Discovery:** Cannot list or search for gauges - must know IDs in advance
2. **No Flood Predictions:** `/floodStatus` returns 404 for all tested gauges
3. **Manual ID Required:** System works IF you have gauge IDs from external sources
4. **Unknown Total Coverage:** Cannot determine total Pakistan gauge count

### üí° How the API Actually Works

```python
# ‚úÖ THIS WORKS (if you have the gauge ID):
gauge_data = api.get_gauge("hybas_4120570410")      # Returns gauge details
thresholds = api.get_gauge_model("hybas_4120570410") # Returns warning levels

# ‚ùå THIS DOESN'T WORK:
all_gauges = api.list_gauges()                      # 404 Error
flood_status = api.get_flood_status(gauge_id)       # 404 Error
```

### üìä Verified API Functionality

| Endpoint | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `/gauges/{id}` | ‚úÖ Working | Individual gauge details only |
| `/gaugeModels/{id}` | ‚úÖ Working | Threshold data available |
| `/gauges` | ‚ùå 404 Error | Cannot list all gauges |
| `/gauges:search` | ‚ùå 404 Error | No geographic search |
| `/floodStatus` | ‚ùå 404 Error | No predictions available |

### üìä Coverage Statistics

- **Total Pakistani Gauges:** UNKNOWN (API limitation)
- **Verified Gauges:** 2 (manually discovered)
- **Quality Verified:** 1 of 2 (50%)
- **Have Models:** 2 of 2 (100%)
- **Real-time Predictions:** 0 (API not functional)

## Technical Assessment

### ‚úÖ API Functionality
- **Authentication:** Working with provided API key
- **Gauge Metadata:** Successfully retrievable
- **Model Data:** Available with detailed thresholds
- **Data Quality:** High (quality verified + model)

### ‚ùå API Limitations
- **Area Search:** Not available/accessible
- **Flood Status:** Real-time data endpoint not working
- **Gauge Discovery:** No bulk listing capability
- **Coverage:** Severely limited for Pakistan

## Recommendations for Pak-FEWS

### Immediate Actions
1. **Build Gauge ID Database** - Manually compile list of Pakistani gauge IDs
2. **Use Both Verified Gauges** - Monitor hybas_4121489010 (verified) AND hybas_4120570410 (Chitral)
3. **Accept Non-Verified Data** - Use Chitral gauge with appropriate disclaimers
4. **Seek Gauge ID Sources** - Contact Google, research papers, or web scraping

### System Design Implications
1. **ID-Based Architecture** - Design system to work with pre-known gauge IDs
2. **Threshold Monitoring** - Use known warning/danger levels even without predictions
3. **Quality Tiering** - Separate verified vs non-verified gauges in UI
4. **Manual Maintenance** - Plan for periodic manual gauge ID updates

### For Chitral Specifically
- **Gauge EXISTS** - hybas_4120570410 is valid and queryable
- **Has Thresholds** - Warning (59.34), Danger (68.96), Extreme (80.03) m¬≥/s
- **Use With Caution** - Not quality verified, but still valuable
- **Cross-Validate** - Compare with local sources when possible

### Research Next Steps
1. **Enhanced API Access** - Apply to Google Flood Hub pilot program
2. **Earth Engine Exploration** - Research Google Earth Engine flood datasets
3. **Local API Investigation** - Explore Pakistani government flood monitoring APIs
4. **International Cooperation** - Connect with regional flood monitoring networks

## Budget Impact

- **Current API Usage:** Free (single gauge)
- **Enhanced Access:** Unknown cost structure
- **Alternative Sources:** Consider open-source options first
- **Development Time:** Additional integration work required

## Additional Findings

### üì¶ Google Cloud Storage Exploration
- **Bucket**: `flood-forecasting` is publicly accessible
- **Content**: Contains hydrologic predictions, NOT inundation history as initially thought
- **Structure**: `hydrologic_predictions/model_id_8583a5c2_v0/` with zarr format data
- **Pakistan Data**: Unable to locate historical flood extent data for Pakistan region

### üîç Key Corrections
1. **Total Accessible Gauges**: 2 verified (not 1 as initially stated)
2. **Quality Verified**: 1 of 2 (50%) - only hybas_4121489010
3. **Historical Data**: Not available in expected format/location
4. **API Functionality**: More limited than typical Google APIs

## Conclusion

Google Flood Hub API functions as a **"gauge lookup service"** rather than a comprehensive flood monitoring API. If you have gauge IDs, you can access valuable threshold data, but you cannot discover gauges or get real-time predictions.

**Key Insights**:
- **Works Well**: Individual gauge queries with known IDs
- **Chitral Gauge**: EXISTS and is USABLE despite not being quality verified
- **Challenge**: Building and maintaining gauge ID database
- **Opportunity**: Both verified and non-verified gauges provide value

**Strategic Approach for Pak-FEWS**:
1. **Phase 1**: Build comprehensive gauge ID list through research
2. **Phase 2**: Query all known gauges for thresholds and metadata
3. **Phase 3**: Implement monitoring using threshold values
4. **Phase 4**: Add real-time data from alternative sources

**Bottom Line**: The API is limited but usable. Success depends on obtaining gauge IDs through external means, then leveraging the threshold data for flood monitoring.
