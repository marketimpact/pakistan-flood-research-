# Google Flood Hub Pakistan Research Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (30 min)
```bash
# Create project structure
mkdir -p flood-hub-research/{data,scripts,reports,visualizations}
cd flood-hub-research

# Initialize Python environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows

# Install required packages
pip install requests pandas geopandas folium matplotlib seaborn python-dotenv
```

## Phase 2: API Connection & Basic Inventory (1 hour)

### Task 1: Create API wrapper script
**File: `scripts/flood_hub_api.py`**
- Implement basic API client class
- Add methods for each endpoint
- Include rate limiting and error handling
- Test with single gauge query

### Task 2: Query all Pakistani gauges
**File: `scripts/gauge_inventory.py`**
- Define Pakistan bounding box (23-37°N, 60-77°E)
- Query all gauges within bounds
- Filter for Pakistani territory only
- Export to `data/gauge_inventory.csv`

### Expected columns:
- gaugeId, latitude, longitude, river, siteName
- qualityVerified, hasModel, source
- province (derive from coordinates)

## Phase 3: Deep Dive Analysis (2-3 hours)

### Task 3: Analyze gauge quality and coverage
**File: `scripts/coverage_analysis.py`**
- Calculate statistics:
  - Total gauges vs quality verified
  - Gauges with/without models
  - Distribution by province
  - Coverage of major rivers
- Generate `data/coverage_analysis.json`

### Task 4: Threshold investigation
**File: `scripts/threshold_analysis.py`**
- For each quality-verified gauge:
  - Fetch gauge model data
  - Extract warning/danger/extreme thresholds
  - Document units (meters vs m³/s)
  - Note if thresholds missing
- Export to `data/threshold_analysis.csv`

### Task 5: Flood status sampling
**File: `scripts/flood_status_check.py`**
- Query current flood status for all gauges
- Document:
  - Which have active predictions
  - Severity levels distribution
  - Forecast time ranges
  - Inundation map availability
- Look for patterns in map availability

## Phase 4: Visualization (1 hour)

### Task 6: Create coverage map
**File: `scripts/create_map.py`**
- Use Folium to create interactive map
- Color code by:
  - Green: Quality verified with model
  - Yellow: Has model but not verified
  - Red: No model/unverified
- Add major rivers overlay
- Export to `visualizations/coverage_map.html`

### Task 7: Statistical visualizations
**File: `scripts/create_charts.py`**
- Bar chart: Gauges by province
- Pie chart: Quality verified percentage
- Timeline: Forecast lead times
- Export as PNG files

## Phase 5: Report Generation (1 hour)

### Task 8: Compile findings
**File: `reports/research_findings.md`**
Structure:
1. Executive Summary
   - Total coverage statistics
   - Key findings
   - Critical gaps
   
2. Detailed Analysis
   - Quality verification insights
   - Threshold patterns
   - Map availability analysis
   - River-by-river coverage
   
3. Technical Findings
   - API limitations
   - Data quality issues
   - Update frequencies
   
4. Recommendations
   - Priority gauges for monitoring
   - System design implications
   - Risk areas without coverage

## Phase 6: Special Investigations

### Task 9: Historical data exploration
- Check flood-forecasting bucket on Google Cloud Storage
- Assess usability of historical inundation data
- Document data format and coverage

### Task 10: Decode mystery parameters
- Research what "HYBAS" source means
- Investigate return period calculations
- Find documentation on probability levels

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All major Pakistani rivers checked
- [ ] Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad area coverage verified
- [ ] 2022 flood affected areas assessed
- [ ] API rate limits documented
- [ ] Error cases handled and logged

## Quick Test Commands
```python
# Test API connection
python scripts/flood_hub_api.py --test

# Run full inventory
python scripts/gauge_inventory.py --country pakistan

# Generate report
python scripts/generate_report.py --format markdown
```

## Success Criteria
1. Complete inventory of Pakistani gauges
2. Clear understanding of data quality standards
3. Actionable recommendations for system design
4. Visual proof of coverage/gaps
5. All research questions answered with evidence
